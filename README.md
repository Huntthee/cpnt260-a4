# Doc's Wonderland Rust Server
## This website has been and will continue to be developed for my longtime friend Mason Kaye aka 'Doc Holliday' and his Rust server, so long as it stands.
>**04/14/21** This server is no longer hosted

I met Doc on Rust about 5 years ago and we've remained friends since. Now we run our own server and I have used the opportunity of this assignment to create a website for the players who visit our server. 

The website will contain server news for updates and upcoming changes, a section for frequently asked questions, maybe even some simple starter guides for the new players.
